    Openverse is a search engine for openly-licensed media. The Openverse
    API is a system that allows programmatic access to public domain digital
    media. It is our ambition to index and catalog billions of
    openly-licensed works, including articles, songs, videos, photographs,
    paintings, and more.

    Using this API, developers will be able to access the digital commons in
    their own applications. You can see some examples of
    [apps built with Openverse](https://docs.openverse.org/api/reference/made_with_ov.html)
    in our docs.

        Return audio files that match the query.

        This endpoint allows you to search within specific fields, or to retrieve
        a collection of all audio files from a specific source, creator or tag.
        Results are paginated on the basis of the `page` parameter. The `page_size`
        parameter controls the total number of pages.

        Although there may be millions of relevant records, only the most relevant
        or the most recent several thousand records can be viewed. This is by design:
        the search endpoint should be used to find the top 10,000 most relevant
        results, not for exhaustive search or bulk download of every barely relevant
        result. As such, the caller should not try to access pages beyond `page_count`,
        or else the server will reject the query.

        ### Default search
        The **default search** allows users to find media based on a query string.
        It supports a wide range of optional filters to narrow down search results
        according to specific needs.

        By default, this endpoint performs a full-text search for the value of `q` parameter.
        You can search within the `creator`, `title` or `tags` fields by omitting
        the `q` parameter and using one of these field parameters.
        These results can be filtered by `source`, `excluded_source`, `license`, `license_type`, `creator`, `tags`, `title`, `filter_dead`, `extension`, `mature`, `unstable__include_sensitive_results`, `category` and `length`.

        The default search results are sorted by relevance.

        ### Collection search
        The collection search allows to retrieve a collection of media from a specific source,
        creator or tag. The `unstable__collection` parameter is used to specify the type of collection to retrieve.

        - `unstable__collection=tag&unstable__tag=tagName` will return the media with tag `tagName`.
        - `unstable__collection=source&source=sourceName` will return the media from source `sourceName`.
        - `unstable__collection=creator&creator=creatorName&source=sourceName` will return the media by creator `creatorName` at `sourceName`.

        Collection results are sorted by the time they were added to Openverse, with the most recent
        additions appearing first. The filters such as `license` are not available for collections.

          **Creator collection**
          When used with `unstable__collection=creator&source=sourceName`, returns the collection of media
          by the specified creator. Notice that a single creator's media items
          can be found on several sources, but this collection only returns the
          items from the specified source.
          This is why for this collection, both the creator and the source
          parameters are required, and matched exactly. For a fuzzy creator search,
          use the default search without the `unstable__collection` parameter.

          **Creator search**
          When used without the `unstable__collection` parameter, will search in the creator field only.
          The search is fuzzy, so `creator=john` will match any value that includes the
          word `john`. If the value contains space, items that contain any of
          the words in the value will match. To search for several values,
          join them with a comma.

          The kind of media collection to return.

          Must be used with `unstable__tag`, `source` or `creator`+`source`

          * `tag` - tag

          may change or be removed without notice in future updates. Use them
          with caution as they are not covered by our API versioning policy._



          _Must be used with `unstable__collection=tag`_

          Get the collection of media with a specific tag. Returns the collection of media
          that has the specified tag, matching exactly and entirely.

          Differences that will cause tags to not match are:
          - upper and lower case letters
          - diacritical marks
          - hyphenation
          - spacing
          - multi-word tags where the query is only one of the words in the tag
          - multi-word tags where the words are in a different order.

          Examples of tags that **do not** match:
          - "Low-Quality" and "low-quality"
          - "jalapeño" and "jalapeno"
          - "Saint Pierre des Champs" and "Saint-Pierre-des-Champs"
          - "dog walking" and "dog  walking" (where the latter has two spaces between the
          last two words, as in a typographical error)
          - "runner" and "marathon runner"
          - "exclaiming loudly" and "loudly exclaiming"

          For non-exact or multi-tag matching, using the `tags` query parameter.

        Return images that match the query.

        This endpoint allows you to search within specific fields, or to retrieve
        a collection of all images from a specific source, creator or tag.
        Results are paginated on the basis of the `page` parameter. The `page_size`
        parameter controls the total number of pages.

        Although there may be millions of relevant records, only the most relevant
        or the most recent several thousand records can be viewed. This is by design:
        the search endpoint should be used to find the top 10,000 most relevant
        results, not for exhaustive search or bulk download of every barely relevant
        result. As such, the caller should not try to access pages beyond `page_count`,
        or else the server will reject the query.

        ### Default search
        The **default search** allows users to find media based on a query string.
        It supports a wide range of optional filters to narrow down search results
        according to specific needs.

        By default, this endpoint performs a full-text search for the value of `q` parameter.
        You can search within the `creator`, `title` or `tags` fields by omitting
        the `q` parameter and using one of these field parameters.
        These results can be filtered by `source`, `excluded_source`, `license`, `license_type`, `creator`, `tags`, `title`, `filter_dead`, `extension`, `mature`, `unstable__include_sensitive_results`, `category`, `aspect_ratio` and `size`.

        The default search results are sorted by relevance.

        ### Collection search
        The collection search allows to retrieve a collection of media from a specific source,
        creator or tag. The `unstable__collection` parameter is used to specify the type of collection to retrieve.

        - `unstable__collection=tag&unstable__tag=tagName` will return the media with tag `tagName`.
        - `unstable__collection=source&source=sourceName` will return the media from source `sourceName`.
        - `unstable__collection=creator&creator=creatorName&source=sourceName` will return the media by creator `creatorName` at `sourceName`.

        Collection results are sorted by the time they were added to Openverse, with the most recent
        additions appearing first. The filters such as `license` are not available for collections.

          **Creator collection**
          When used with `unstable__collection=creator&source=sourceName`, returns the collection of media
          by the specified creator. Notice that a single creator's media items
          can be found on several sources, but this collection only returns the
          items from the specified source.
          This is why for this collection, both the creator and the source
          parameters are required, and matched exactly. For a fuzzy creator search,
          use the default search without the `unstable__collection` parameter.

          **Creator search**
          When used without the `unstable__collection` parameter, will search in the creator field only.
          The search is fuzzy, so `creator=john` will match any value that includes the
          word `john`. If the value contains space, items that contain any of
          the words in the value will match. To search for several values,
          join them with a comma.

          The kind of media collection to return.

          Must be used with `unstable__tag`, `source` or `creator`+`source`

          _Must be used with `unstable__collection=tag`_

          Get the collection of media with a specific tag. Returns the collection of media
          that has the specified tag, matching exactly and entirely.

          Differences that will cause tags to not match are:
          - upper and lower case letters
          - diacritical marks
          - hyphenation
          - spacing
          - multi-word tags where the query is only one of the words in the tag
          - multi-word tags where the words are in a different order.

          Examples of tags that **do not** match:
          - "Low-Quality" and "low-quality"
          - "jalapeño" and "jalapeno"
          - "Saint Pierre des Champs" and "Saint-Pierre-des-Champs"
          - "dog walking" and "dog  walking" (where the latter has two spaces between the
          last two words, as in a typographical error)
          - "runner" and "marathon runner"
          - "exclaiming loudly" and "loudly exclaiming"

          For non-exact or multi-tag matching, using the `tags` query parameter.

    Openverse provides free and open access to the Openverse API to
    anonymous and registered users. [Refer to the API documentation
    site for information on how to register](https://api.openverse.org/v1/#tag/auth).

    All Openverse API users are subject to rate limits and restrictions
    on how much of Openverse's dataset can be accessed through the API.
    [Individuals should contact Openverse to request expanded access to
    the API](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse#keep-in-touch).
    Requests are considered on a case-by-case basis and are subject to
    evaluation in light of [Openverse's Terms of Service](https://docs.openverse.org/terms_of_service.html).
    Escalated access may be revoked at any time.

    To authenticate yourself, you must sign up for an API key using
    the `register` endpoint and then get an access token using the
    `token` endpoint. Read on to know about these endpoints.

    In subsequent requests, include your access token as a bearer
    token in the `Authorization` header.

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
    ```

    ### Rate limits

    Openverse endpoints are rate limited. Anonymous requests should be
    sufficient for most users. Indeed, https://openverse.org itself
    operates using anonymous requests from the browser.

    Registered users are automatically granted slightly higher limits.
    Further increases to rate limits are available upon request (see above).

    Every Openverse API response that was subject to rate-limits includes
    headers outlining the permitted and available usage. Exceeding the limit
    will result in '429: Too Many Requests' responses.

    ### Pagination

    Openverse's dataset is valuable, and the
    [Terms of Service](https://docs.openverse.org/terms_of_service.html)
    disallow scraping under all circumstances. As such, pagination
    for anonymous users is limited, accommodating only the typical
    usage on https://openverse.org. Pagination is limited in terms
    of the size of individual pages and the total number of works
    visible for a query (pagination depth).

    Authenticated users are subject to the same limit of total works
    available for a query, but may request larger individual pages.

    Increases to pagination limits on page size and total depth are
    available upon request (see above).
